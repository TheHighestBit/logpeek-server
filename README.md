TODO:
 - Finish styling the module component
 - Also add another sparkline for last 7 days of logs
 - Small issue with the sparkline bar heights
 - Fix system info component changing size
 - Disable the go to last page on the log table
 - Add max number of wrong password attempts

Dashboard:
 - An indicator of current health, eg. if the number of logs in the last hour is higher or lower than normal.

Ideas for future:
 - If possible, when user clicks on a timeframe in the sparkline, take them to log table page with correct time range.
