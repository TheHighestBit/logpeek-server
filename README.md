TODO:
 - Fix the log table resizing itself
 - Fix padding on the sparkline times
 - Create snackbar for displaying errors/messages

Dashboard:
 - An indicator of current health, eg. if the number of logs in the last hour is higher or lower than normal.

Ideas for future:
 - If possible, when user clicks on a timeframe in the sparkline, take them to log table page with correct time range.
