TODO:
 - Test if the environment based settings work properly
 - Finalize log buffer component styling/placement/size
 - Disable the go to last page on the log table

Dashboard:
 - An indicator of current health, eg. if the number of logs in the last hour is higher or lower than normal.

Ideas for future:
 - If possible, when user clicks on a timeframe in the sparkline, take them to log table page with correct time range.
